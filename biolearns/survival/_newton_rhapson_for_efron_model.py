The enclosed functions are rewrited from python package "lifelines" with specific
version=0.25.2.
lifelines is one of the greatest python packages for survival analysis, it provides
many useful functions. However, the package itself updates  frequently and may not
always compatible with biolearns. Thus we extract these lifelines functions in the
version free manner.

    """
    Calculates the first and second order vector differentials, with respect to beta.
    Note that X, T, E are assumed to be sorted on T!

    A good explanation for Efron. Consider three of five subjects who fail at the time.
    As it is not known a priori that who is the first to fail, so one-third of
    (φ1 + φ2 + φ3) is adjusted from sum_j^{5} φj after one fails. Similarly two-third
    of (φ1 + φ2 + φ3) is adjusted after first two individuals fail, etc.

    From https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/survival/survival.pdf:

    "Setting all weights to 2 for instance will give the same coefficient estimate but halve the variance. When
    the Efron approximation for ties (default) is employed replication of the data will not give exactly the same coefficients as the
    weights option, and in this case the weighted fit is arguably the correct one."

    Parameters
    ----------
    X: array
        (n,d) numpy array of observations.
    T: array
        (n) numpy array representing observed durations.

        (n) numpy array representing death events.
    weights: array
        (n) an array representing weights per observation.
    beta: array
        (1, d) numpy array of coefficients.
