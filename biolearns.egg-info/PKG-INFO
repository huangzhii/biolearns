### 1. Read TCGA Data

#### Example: Read TCGA Breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA) data

Data is downloaded directly from https://gdac.broadinstitute.org/.
The results here are in whole or part based upon data generated by 
the TCGA Research Network: https://www.cancer.gov/tcga.

```python
from biolearns.dataset import TCGA
```

```python
brca = TCGA('BRCA')
mRNAseq = brca.mRNAseq
clinical = brca.clinical
```

#### TCGA cancer table shortcut:

### 2. Gene Co-expression Analysis

We firstly download and access the mRNAseq data.
```python
from biolearns.dataset import TCGA

brca = TCGA('BRCA')
mRNAseq = brca.mRNAseq
```

mRNAseq data is noisy. We filter out 50% of genes with lowest mean values, and then filter out 50% remained genes with lowest variance values.

```python
from biolearns.preprocessing import expression_filter
mRNAseq = expression_filter(mRNAseq, meanq = 0.5, varq = 0.5)
```

We then use lmQCM class to create an lmQCM object ```lobj```.

The gene co-expression analysis is performed by simply call the ```fit()``` function.

```python
from biolearns.coexpression import lmQCM

lobj = lmQCM(mRNAseq)
clusters, genes, eigengene_mat = lobj.fit()
```

### 3. Univariate survival analysis

We firstly download and access the mRNAseq data. Use breast cancer as an example.
```python
from biolearns.dataset import TCGA

brca = TCGA('BRCA')
mRNAseq = brca.mRNAseq
```

We import logranktest from survival subpackage. Choose gene "ABLIM3" as the univariate input.
```python
from biolearns.survival import logranktest

r = mRNAseq.loc['ABLIM3',].values
```

We find the intersection of univariate, time, and event data
```python
bcd_m = [b[:12] for b in mRNAseq.columns]
bcd_p = [b[:12] for b in clinical.index]
bcd = np.intersect1d(bcd_m, bcd_p)

r = r[np.nonzero(np.in1d(bcd, bcd_m))[0]]
t = brca.overall_survival_time[np.nonzero(np.in1d(bcd, bcd_p))[0]]
e = brca.overall_survival_event[np.nonzero(np.in1d(bcd, bcd_p))[0]]
```

We perform log-rank test:

```python
logrank_results, fig = logranktest(r[~np.isnan(t)], t[~np.isnan(t)], e[~np.isnan(t)])
test_statistic, p_value = logrank_results.test_statistic, logrank_results.p_value
```

The output figure looks like:
